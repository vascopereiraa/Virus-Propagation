# Virus Propagation
Final Project for Programming class @ [Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra](https://www.isec.pt/PT/Default.aspx)\
Fist year - Second Semester -- Year 2019/2020

## About the work
My job was to create a program using C language to simulate the propagation of a Virus in a certain space and population.
The space was stored in a dinamic array and the population was stored in a simple linked list.\
The main purpose was:
  - Advance 1 iteration at time in the simulation (Each iteration corresponds to 1 day in the simulation)
  - Show statistics
  - Add a new sick person to the simulation
  - Transfer people between linked spaces
  - Recover the last 3 iterations in the simulation

## Avaluation
In this project I got 99,5% out of 100%

## Guide


## Usage
In order to run the program as it is I recommend to use [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb120/nb120.html) with the C/C++ extension
