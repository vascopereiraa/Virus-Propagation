# Virus Propagation
Final Project for Programming class @ [Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra](https://www.isec.pt/PT/Default.aspx)\
Fist year - Second Semester -- Year 2019/2020

## About the work
My job was to create a program using C language to simulate the propagation of a Virus in a certain space and population.
The space was stored in a dinamic array and the population was stored in a simple linked list.\
The main purpose was:
  - Advance 1 iteration at time in the simulation (Each iteration corresponds to 1 day in the simulation)
  - Show statistics
  - Add a new sick person to the simulation
  - Transfer people between linked spaces
  - Recover the last 3 iterations in the simulation
  
All the iteractions with the user in the command-line are in Portuguese.

## Avaluation
In this project I got 99,5% out of 100%

## Guide
As well as all iteractions are in portuguese, the guides to the work are in the same language.\

[Extra Guide](Enunciado_Extra.pdf)

## Usage
In order to run the program as it is I recommend to use [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb120/nb120.html) with the C/C++ extension

## Files
In the repository, along with the source code I have text files and binary files, them are used to run the code.\
The population to fill the linked list is saved in text files and the spaces are stored in the binary files.\
